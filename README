This is has code ripped out of ROMS for computing the i,j positions
of floats initialized with lat,lon positions.

This code has things hard-coded for NEP6, I'm afraid, including reading
the floats_NEP.in file. This hard-coding happens in get_grid.f95 for the
grid filename and in main3d.f95 for the grid dimensions and vertical
stretching parameters, plus of course the name of the floats.in file.

Then there's hindices, currently hard-coded for the Arctic, where
going "north" of the North Pole is problematic.
